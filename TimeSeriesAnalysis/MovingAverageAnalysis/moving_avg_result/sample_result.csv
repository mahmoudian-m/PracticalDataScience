10000.0,2007-10-17,"I am a railroad engineer for CSX transportation and am relocating my family to North Carolina.  In order to do this move, we need to settle all of our delinquent debts and move with a clean slate.   My family is my wife, Stacey, our 3 year old daughter, Mackenzie, and our 11 month old son, Noah.   We have a doggie named Dickens, and yes, of course, he's family.  It will cost us a few thousand to relocated with a moving company.  We need payment to rent an apartment and security, etc.    I will be starting a new position in North Carolina, so we will be with little pay until my training session ends.  We need to be able to have money for rent and take care of the children's needs for at least a couple months.    Thank you for your kind consideration.

25000.0,2007-10-19,"Greetings!  My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home.  The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we undertook a few small projects to update certain areas and improve certain features (such as improving the airflow for our air conditioner).  We ended up overspending our budget, and ended up putting the excess on our credit cards.  We are looking to consolidate some credit card debt that we incurred in the process of fixing up our new place.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!",679.0,18.9%,922xx,CO,< 1 year,0.0,555.74

15000.0,2007-11-27,"Nobody ever wants to go in to debt. When I met my husband 4 years ago, I had a few small credit cards that I was able to pay off without much help. I thought I was home free after that.  Well, things change. In late 2004, I was laid off two weeks before Christmas. That same week, we got a $300 gas bill and our only car died. We had no other option but to take out a $5000 line of credit to get a car. I started looking for work right away, but as the months rolled by, we had to turn to the line of credit to live.  Not too long after I was laid off, I found out I was pregnant. We were excited, yet terrified. How would we afford this on one income? I eventually did get a job, but making less than $7 an hour part time didn't do much at all. Our beautiful daughter came into the world on September 13, 2005. Soon after, we got a credit card to transfer some high interest balances and pay off our hospital bill.  For a while, things were okay. We weren't doing great, but we were surviving. Day by day, we sunk further into debt. And then the unthinkable happened- my husband was laid off. We both looked for jobs, but nothing came in for four months.  Another credit card entered the scene, which we essentially lived off of.  Excluding my looming student loans (I graduate in May), our current debt hovers around the $15,000 mark. My school schedule and my husband's work schedule finally allowed me to go back to work in August. Two incomes is better than one, but we're still struggling.  Getting a loan to consolidate everything would be a life saver. We're paying as high as 19% interest on one credit card. With student loan payments in the near future, and wanting to have another baby, it's essential to get our debt paid down.  ",669.0,32.62%,681xx,NE,< 1 year,0.0,534.20

We are also expecting another child in February. What we are trying to do is consolidate the debt acrued during the move and buy the essentials for our new arrival. We have managed to buy a crib and dresser, but still need much more! We would also like to put some in savings and be able to buy our 11 year old son a few things for Christmas as well. Normally, we would not have this problem as my wife is a nurse, but she is unable to work right now due to pregnancy complications.

12450.0,2007-12-01,"WHY I NEED A LOAN 	Sixteen years ago I started a business that was on its way the first 12 months to netting $120,000- pretax profit. 	Then, suddenly, I had a nervous breakdown. Couldn't work. No motivation. Exhausted my savings. Had to go on early, discounted Social Security. 	Thanks largely to my anti-depressant, I chucked all symptoms except one: no matter how early nor late I went to bed, I couldn't get up in the morning for work. If I tried even walking downstairs for the paper before my brain said ""OK,"" I'd get sick to my stomach, unable to do anything productive the rest of the day. 	I got wind of a hospital's sleep lab. ""You have 'restless leg syndrome,' advised the doctor. ""I'd like to start you on this new medicine.""  	A few weeks ago I realized that no matter what time I had been going to bed, so long as my brain was comfortable with the notion...and I had had 8 to 9 hours in bed the night before, I could safely get up for the day. Nor, most times, would I feel the least drowsy until bedtime. 	From a previous 14 to 15 total bed hours nightly  I had needed for several previous years, I now needed but 8 or 9. 	My doctor and I both figure that, if I was ""running a Marathon nightly in my sleep, eventually I'd run out of energy. And stop thrashing. And sleep motionless. Until rested. No wonder I needed 6-7 extra hours in bed.""  MY FINANCIAL SITUATION 	Voila! I could now re-start my profession. Except..........the paradox...the irony of it all...was...now that I'm fit and ready to roll, I don't have the money I need to jump-start my former business.                 I'm confident I'll net at least $100,000- first 12 months. 	While I was a New York City-based actor, I taught as a hired gun for Communispond, the world's first, and by far premier trainers of top, multi-national, corporate executives in stand-up presentation and media skills. 3,000 +  CEOs, EVPs and other officers, supervisors and ""comers"" with such well-known, respected companies as IBM, GM, ATT, PepsiCo, 3M, etc. 	A typical post-program participant comment was, ""Wow! I should have taken this 20 years ago!""                 I quit in order to create a more versatile, measurable program. I researched, developed, tested before audiences the most versatile, most effective, simplest to use stand-up presentation skills program on the world market. 	It serves any speaker, under any circumstances, speaking to any size audience on any topic on which the speaker is expert. And.....measure results against intention.....anonymously. 	I give a full, money-back guarantee. My graduates (1) don't memorize a thing, (2) don't use notes, (3) they neither write nor read long-winded, boring, speeches! 	I got six huge photo-features in major NYC suburban daily papers, plus, a piece in an Albuquerque, New Mexico daily. 	I wrote and published PRESENTER.  Got glowing testimonials from the top human resources officers of Fortune 500 companies and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale.  SPECIAL BONUS OFFER 	If I achieve my loan request, I will give you, absolutely FREE, one autographed copy of PRESENTER *  for each one-thousand DOLLARS OF YOUR LOAN. For example, if you take $3,000- of the loan, I'll give you 3 copies of my book; one-thousand, one copy. Eight hundred fifty dollars? sorry, no FREE, autographed book.   *       Praised by top, multi-national corporate human resource VPs, EVPs such as Gannett Corp., ConAgra, Gibson Greetings, 3M...and the late Norman Vincent Peale.          Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery of new and revised, second edition, PRESENTER, printing.  ",552.0,7.56%,124xx,NY,10+ years,0.0,569.64

3500.0,2007-12-09,"Good day, I appreciate your consideration of my loan request.   Currently, I work as an independent contractor for the Federal Government, driving for a limousine service which transports Congressmen, Senators and other Government officials around Washington, DC. I am a very trustworthy and honest person with security clearance and have been with this company for almost 2 years. Prior to that, I managed a restaurant for over 20 years.   Purpose of Loan:  If I am fortunate to be granted a loan through LendingClub, I would use the money to pay my son's medical bill.  He has a $2,500 medical bill that I would like to pay off for him.   This is not a loan out of necessity....I am relatively debt free and have few expenses. I recently moved into my son's in-law suite in his home and do not have to pay rent, nor do I have any other living expenses such as utilities, however, I do help out with groceries and other small expenses.   Total Amount Requested: $3500 Monthly Net Income: I earn an average of $3,000/mo. net from my job as a diplomatic chauffeur, not including overtime.   Monthly Expenses BEFORE LendingClub Loan: $1,110  Housing: $ 0  Insurance: $ 110  Car expenses: $ 200  Utilities: $ 0  Phone, cable, internet: $ 0  Food, entertainment: $ 300  Clothing, household expenses $ 100  Credit cards and other loans: $ 150  Other expenses: $ 250   Monthly Expenses AFTER LendingClub Loan: $1,250(includes LendingClub loan payment of $150)   As you can see, I will have $1,800 left from my salary after payment of my LendingClub loan.   I have good credit and take my obligations very seriously.  According to my Experian credit report, my credit score is 712. I pride myself on always making my payments on time & will continue to do so with this LendingClub loan. I have a very clean credit history with NO Delinquencies in the past seven years. Improving my credit score is extremely important to me. I can reassure lenders that their investment in me is very safe. The repayment of my LendingClub loan will be the 1st priority each month, with payments automatically withdrawn from my bank account. I promise to make all my payments on time & never default on this loan. Thank you again for considering my loan request!  ",684.0,14.7%,200xx,DC,2 years,0.0,503.44

I am a business owner starting up a personal development and coaching company, but I cannot help others if this does not get taken care of.  Once this loan is completed I will offer free coaching and free access to all of the books I have authored as a bonus.  This is not a gimmick, I just want to help people and keep my head above water.  Let me know if you have any questions, and go ahead and start processing the loan.

20000.0,2007-12-12,"This loan is to help pay off a high interest rate credit card and allow us (me and my wife) to save money or to boost the payment of the credit card account.   We both have a stable work at the University and medical center.  I am a very hard worker, and a valuable member of my research laboratory and the University.  My wife also works with me in the same division.  I use to have a good credit score because I make payments on time, every time.  I pay my bills before they are due, but lately, because of the high APR of my credit card, we have been very tight to keep this good history going.  We don�t want to �consolidate� or �settle� our payment, because we want to keep our account history.  There is no intention to fall in the credit �trap� again.  Lowering my APR, we�ll be ok, and in our way to pursue our financial plan.  I�m sure that in a short period of time we�ll pay our debt, and we�ll also be in the position to turn around and help others.  Thank you for considering my loan.

I had never gave this a thought before the divorce but now I find that it is not a good thing not to have some debt!  I am a 30-year old other of two.  I have a positive work history and steady income.  I feel that financially I am in a good place but this is not reflected by my credit report since I have never had credit!!!  After a lot of research I think that peer-to-peer lending will give me the opportunity to get established.   ,0.0,0%,356xx,AL,< 1 year,0.0,538.92
