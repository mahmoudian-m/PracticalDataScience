# Time Series Analysis

## **Overview**
The **TimeSeriesAnalysis** directory showcases projects focused on analyzing time-series data to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and forecast trends. These projects apply statistical techniques like Moving Averages (MA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to address real-world problems in financial risk assessment and structural monitoring.

## **Projects**

### **1. Moving Average Analysis**
- **Purpose:** To analyze loan risk scores by calculating 50-day Moving Averages (MA50) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA50) for 2007.
- **Highlights:**
  - Python and Bash scripts for extracting and analyzing financial data.
  - MA50 and EMA50 calculations provide smoothed trends for better decision-making.
- **Applications:** Financial institutions can use this analysis to identify risk trends and improve lending strategies.

### **2. Stationarity in Time Series**
- **Purpose:** Explore the concept of stationarity, why it is essential, and how to visualize and test for it.
- **Techniques:**
  - Visualizations
  	- Line Plot
	- ACF/PACF
	- Rolling Statistics 
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
