# **Statistics for Data Science**

## **Overview**
Statistics is the backbone of data science, providing the foundation for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling. This section explores key statistical concepts, techniques, and methods that are essential for understanding and interpreting data.

### **Topics Covered**
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing and visualizing data.
2. **Inferential Statistics**: Drawing conclusions about populations from samples.
3. **Testing Normality**: Assessing data distribution.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Understanding t-tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests.
5. **Correlation and Regression**: Exploring relationships between variables.

## **1. Descriptive Statistics**
Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main characteristics of data.
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode.
- **Measures of Spread**: Variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatterplots

## **2. Inferential Statistics**
Inferential statistics help make predictions and generalizations about a population from a sample.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating the range within which a population parameter lies.
- **Sampling Distributions**: Understanding the distribution of sample statistics.
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Null and alternative hypotheses.
  - p-values and significance levels.

## **3. Testing Normality**
Normality is critical for parametric tests. This section includes:
- **Descriptive Techniques**:
  - **Skewness** and **Kurtosis**: Quantify asymmetry and tailedness of the data.
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - **Shapiro-Wilk Test**
  - **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**
  - **Anderson-Darling Test**
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Histograms with KDE**
  - **Q-Q Plots**
  - **Boxplots**

## **4. Hypothesis Testing**
Hypothesis testing is used to compare groups and assess relationships.
- **Parametric Tests** (assume normality):
  - **t-tests**: Comparing two groups.
  - **ANOVA**: Comparing multiple groups.
- **Non-Parametric Tests** (do not assume normality):
  - **Mann-Whitney U Test**
  - **Kruskal-Wallis Test**
  - **Chi-Square Test**

---

## **5. Correlation and Regression**
These methods explore relationships between variables.
- **Correlation**:
  - Pearson (linear relationship for normal data).
  - Spearman (monotonic relationship for non-normal data).
- **Regression**:
  - Linear regression for predictive modeling.
  - Logistic regression for categorical outcomes.

I aim to share projects that are not only technically sound but also applicable to solving real-world problems.

## Key Highlights
- Each folder contains well-documented projects, including **Python code**, **Bash scripts**, and **visualizations**.
- Clear, step-by-step instructions to replicate the results.
- Insights into how these techniques can be applied in industry contexts.
